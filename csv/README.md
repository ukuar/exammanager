We're trying to build a CSV generator to replace the Candidate Application Forms currently used by the RSGB. 

## Initial concept

Simple HTML form that works client-side to collect the required data, then spits out a CSV file which can be passed on to the exam secretary

## Fields

* Title
* First Name
* Middle Name
* Surname
* Callsign
* Date of Birth
* Gender
* Address
* Postcode
* Telephone
* Mobile
* Email Address
* Exam Venue
* Exam Date
* Resit
*Special Requirements
